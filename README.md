# Learning C

I have decided to learn C and got my self Mike McGraths' book "C Programming" of the "in easy steps" book series. All the programs are the exercises of the book, sorted into the chapters. To get the chapter description, best buy the book :smile:

## Used Technologies/Languages

- C

## Setup

To run any C program, you first need to compile it. On Linux use:

```
gcc your_file.c -o your_file.exe
```

after that you can run it:

```
./your_file.exe
```

Or in one line:

```
gcc your_file.c -o your_file.exe; ./your_file.exe
```

If you want to switch off warnings, add -dM flag to the gcc command.
